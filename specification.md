Target: Minecraft Create Mod Neoforge 1.21.1

Develop a create mod addon that allows the player to see maximum curvature radius and slope while placing a spline track.
Give a multiple choice question for possible methods of displaying the data.
Allow a config to rate the calculated curvature based on thresholds (Suitable for mainline, yards, or too tight entirely. 
Allow a keyboard modifier while placing track (ctrl+alt) to enforce a selected limit as minimum placeable curvature instead of the default.

Expected output format: Standard Neoforge JAR addon file (additional files, if any, included as ZIP file with the JAR)

Work discipline:
- Follow guidelines for Neoforge development closely and use resources on the web to find similar projects that the resolution can be based off of.
- Ask any questions you have to the development before beginning work, and format them as multiple choice forms whenever possible.
- Test your code and make sure you write documentation as you go.
- Treat this as an Open Source project that will be published on GitHub, including the requisite .gitignore and README/License files.
- License is GPLv3 or later.

Environment:
- You are on an Ubuntu 24.04 system. You have access to package managers and basic internet access for web searches.
- You are allowed to install new packages and use the sudo command if required.
- This is a Proxmox LXC container, so things like loop mounts are not available.
- The system is headless, so executing the game may prove difficult.

Please provide small explanations of your progress while you are processing the request.
